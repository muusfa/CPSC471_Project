> Requirements for using the website
- Python 3 is required. Follow the appropriate link below to install it.
- [Windows based System](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Python Windows installation
- [Linux based System](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/) - Python Linux installation
- Ensure you have MYSQL server setup on your computer.
- If you do not have it installed, follow the tutorial at the following link to do so. 
- [MySQL Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIRcpjg-3Eg&ab_channel=edureka%21) - Youtube Video
- Now to create the database, log in to your MYSQL command line tool.
- Create a database called "store_inventory" using the command "CREATE DATABASE store_inventory;"
- We now need to create a user that will access and use our database, do this with the command below:
- "CREATE USER 'djangouser'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';"
- Next, let the database know that our djangouser should have complete access to the database we set up:
- "GRANT ALL ON store_inventory.* TO 'djangouser'@'%';"
- We need to flush the privileges so that the current instance of MySQL knows about the recent changes weâ€™ve made:
- "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"
- Once you have made these changes, restart your MySQL server. If you have any difficulties follow the link below:
- [Connecting MySQL to Django](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-django-app-and-connect-it-to-a-database) - Further Information
- Once the database has been created, copy the contents of each text file from the folder "./databasescripts"...
- And paste them into empty stored procedures that you have created within the database. 
- If you do not know how to create stored procedures in MYSQL...
- Follow the instructions in the link below.
- [Creating Stored Procedures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPoxqvPD6Do&ab_channel=RamNJavaTutorial) - Youtube Video.

```bash
$ # Get the code
$ git clone https://github.com/muusfa/CPSC471_Project.git
$ cd CPSC471_project
$
$ # Virtualenv modules installation (Unix based systems)
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$
$ # Virtualenv modules installation (Windows based systems)
$ # virtualenv env
$ # .\env\Scripts\activate
$
$ # Install modules
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$
$
$ # Create tables
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
$
$ # Finally, create an administrative user to use the admin interface
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
$ # You will be prompted for a username, an email address, and a password for your user
$
```
<br />

- Now we need to add tuples to our created database, do this by opening the file "loadTuples.txt"
- Copy and enter each line individually from the text file "loadTuples.txt" IN THE ORDER GIVEN into the command line until the end of file has been reached. This should create tuples in your database.

```bash
$ # Start the application (development mode)
$ python manage.py runserver # default port 8000
$
$ # Start the app - custom port
$ # python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:<your_port>
$
$ # Access the web app in browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

> Note: To use the app, please access the registration page and create a new user. After authentication, the app will unlock the private pages.

## Code-base structure

The project is coded using a simple and intuitive structure presented bellow:

```bash

> The bootstrap flow

- Django bootstrapper `manage.py` uses `core/settings.py` as the main configuration file
- `core/settings.py` loads the app magic from `.env` file
- Redirect the guest users to Login page
- Unlock the pages served by *app* node for authenticated users
